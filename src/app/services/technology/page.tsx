            Overview
          </h2>
          <p className="reveal">
            At Dblshot, we build websites designed to do more than exist online. We create digital
            experiences that support business growth, strengthen brand presence, and guide users
            toward action — through a smart balance of strategy, design, and performance.
          </p>
          <p className="reveal">
            From e-commerce websites engineered for frictionless shopping journeys to service-based
            websites built for lead generation on WordPress, Framer, or native platforms — we
            develop every website around a clear commercial goal.
          </p>
          <p className="reveal">
            By combining conversion-focused architecture, enhanced UI and UX design, and CRO tactics
            tailored to each business model, we make sure every stage of the buyer journey is
            supported with purpose. Whether your goal is to drive more purchases, generate more
            qualified leads, or improve how users experience your brand, we build websites that are
            made to perform — not just to exist.
          </p>
